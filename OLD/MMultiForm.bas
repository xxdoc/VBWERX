' Implements multiple duplicate forms for MS Access
'   - adapted from http://allenbrowne.com/ser-35.html
'   - Instatiate new form using 'OpenFormMulti New Form_frmEditRecord, "ID=" & ID'
'   - Call 'CloseFormMulti Me' from Form_Close() event, or you will get weird bugs...
'   - Use generic 'DoCmd.Close' to close the active multi form
'   - Do not use explicit 'DoCmd.Close acForm, Me.Name, acSaveNo'
